    <string name="happy_new_year_lyrics">No more champagne\n And the fireworks are through \n Here we are, me and you \n
    Feeling lost and feeling blue \n It the end of the party \n And the morning seems so grey \n So unlike yesterday \n Now the time for us to say \n
    Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have a vision now and then \n Of a world where every neighbor is a friend \n
    Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have our hopes our will to try \n If we don not we might as well lay down and die \n You and I \n
    Sometimes I see \n How the brave new world arrives \n And I see how it thrives \n In the ashes of our lives \n Oh yes man is a fool
    And he thinks he will  be okay \n Dragging on feet of clay \n Never knowing he is astray \n Keeps on going anyway
    Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have a vision now and then \n Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
    Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have our hopes our will to try \n If we dont we might as well lay down and die
    You and I \n Seems to me now \n That the dreams we had before \n Are all dead nothing more \n Than confetti on the floor
    It is the end of a decade \n In another ten years time \nWho can say what we will find \n What lies waiting down the line
    In the end of eighty nine \n Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have a vision now and then \n Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
    Happy New Year \n Happy New Year \n May we all have our hopes our will to try \n If we dont we might as well lay down and die \nYou and I</string>
